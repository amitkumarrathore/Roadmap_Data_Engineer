Certainly, let's create a focused and time-bound learning path for becoming a data engineer in three months. We'll primarily focus on Python as the programming language since it's widely used in data engineering and has a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools. This plan assumes you already have a basic understanding of SQL and databases, as you mentioned earlier. Here's a step-by-step plan:

**Month 1: Fundamentals of Python and SQL**
- **Week 1-2: Python Basics**
  - Start with Python basics like variables, data types, and basic operations.
  - Resources: Codecademy's Python course, Python.org's official documentation.

- **Week 3-4: Python Data Structures**
  - Learn about lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.
  - Resources: W3Schools' Python Data Structures tutorial, Python.org's documentation.

- **Week 5-6: Functions and Modules in Python**
  - Understand how to create and use functions and modules.
  - Resources: Python.org's tutorial on modules and functions.

- **Week 7-8: SQL Intermediate**
  - Deepen your SQL knowledge with topics like joins, subqueries, and aggregations.
  - Resources: SQLZoo, Mode Analytics SQL tutorials.

**Month 2: Advanced Python and Data Engineering Tools**
- **Week 9-10: Python Libraries**
  - Dive into Python libraries commonly used in data engineering, such as NumPy and Pandas.
  - Resources: Official documentation, YouTube tutorials.

- **Week 11-12: Introduction to Big Data Tools**
  - Learn about Apache Hadoop, Spark, and Kafka, including their basic concepts.
  - Resources: Online tutorials and documentation for each tool.

**Month 3: Advanced Data Engineering and Interview Preparation**
- **Week 13-14: ETL Processes**
  - Study Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes and techniques.
  - Resources: Online articles, YouTube tutorials.

- **Week 15-16: Cloud Platforms**
  - Get hands-on experience with a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, GCP, or Azure).
  - Resources: Use free tiers and documentation provided by cloud providers.

- **Week 17-18: Data Warehousing**
  - Learn about data warehousing concepts and modern data warehouses (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery).
  - Resources: Official documentation, online courses.

- **Week 19-20: Data Modeling**
  - Dive into data modeling, including concepts like star and snowflake schemas.
  - Resources: Online tutorials, books on data modeling.

- **Week 21-22: Data Pipeline Orchestration**
  - Explore tools like Apache Airflow for orchestrating data pipelines.
  - Resources: Official documentation, tutorials on data pipeline orchestration.

- **Week 23-24: Interview Preparation**
  - Review everything you've learned.
  - Practice coding exercises and data engineering-related interview questions.
  - Participate in mock interviews if possible.

Throughout this three-month journey, you can supplement your learning with free online resources, forums, and communities like Stack Overflow, GitHub, and Reddit's data engineering communities. Additionally, consider joining LinkedIn groups related to data engineering to network and stay updated on industry trends.

Remember that hands-on practice is crucial, so try to work on small data engineering projects or exercises related to each topic as you progress. As you near the end of the three months, start applying for data engineering roles in big tech companies and be prepared to discuss your projects and knowledge during interviews.

This plan provides a structured approach to building the skills required for a data engineering role in a big tech company within three months. However, the learning pace may vary from person to person, so feel free to adjust the timeline based on your progress and understanding. Good luck with your journey, and I'm here to assist you with any questions or clarifications you may need along the way!
